# coffeepot_assignment2

A program that fills a simulated coffeepot with water, heats it, and controls the pot with software or hardware interrupts.  Completed as an assignment for ENCM 511 in 2017.

All code files prefixed with "My" are my original work, with the exception of My_CoffeePot_2016main_CPP.cpp, which was modified from a file provided by Dr. Mike Smith, the ENCM 511 professor at the University of Calgary.

This program was intended to run in CrossCore Embedded Studio, with the 2017_CoffeePot_Library_AsOf_7October2017.dlb library file. It also requires the CrossCore Embedded Studio CCES_Files folder to be placed into the CrossCore Embedded Studio 2.6.0 folder within the Analog Devices folder, which is created upon installing CrossCore ES.
